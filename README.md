## üßπ Excel Data Cleaning Steps

All cleaning steps were performed using **Microsoft Excel** and are clearly documented in the `Data_Cleaning_Steps.xlsx` file:

### 1. **Handling Missing Values**
- Identified using `ISBLANK()`
- Filled missing values where appropriate
- Removed rows with critical missing data

### 2. **Removing Duplicates**
- Used `Remove Duplicates` to eliminate repeated rows

### 3. **Standardizing Column Headers**
- Cleaned column names for readability and consistency (e.g., "Job_Title" ‚Üí "Job Title")

### 4. **Correcting Inconsistencies**
- Applied `TRIM()`, `PROPER()`, `UPPER()` to fix formatting issues
- Fixed inconsistent labels for job titles, companies, locations, and employment types

### 5. **Splitting and Combining Columns**
- Used `Text to Columns` to split combined fields (e.g., "Location")
- Merged fields where needed using `&` or `CONCATENATE()`

### 6. **Data Type Formatting**
- Converted salary values to number format
- Standardized all date formats to `YYYY-MM-DD`

### 7. **Outlier Detection (Basic)**
- Used conditional formatting to highlight unusually high or low salary values
- Manually reviewed flagged records

### 8. **Data Validation**
- Applied drop-downs for standard fields (e.g., Employment Type)
- Used `Data Validation` to restrict invalid entries

### 9. **Formulas Used**
- `IF()`, `LEN()`, `FIND()`, `TEXT()`, `SUBSTITUTE()`, `ISNUMBER()`, etc., for logic and transformation

### 10. **Documentation**
- Each step is explained in a dedicated sheet within `Data_Cleaning_Steps.xlsx` for transparency and reproducibility
