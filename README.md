üîç Project Overview
The dataset contains job title, company, location, salary, job level, employment type, and date of posting. Cleaning and organizing this data enables better trend analysis of salary growth in AI, ML, and Data Science roles.

üîß Excel Data Cleaning Steps Included
Each of the following steps is clearly demonstrated and documented in the Excel file:

Handling Missing Data

Used ISBLANK() and filters to identify and manage missing values.

Filled or removed null entries in key fields (e.g., Salary, Job Title).

Removing Duplicates

Used Remove Duplicates tool to eliminate repeated records.

Standardizing Column Names

Renamed headers using proper casing and consistent formatting.

Correcting Inconsistencies

Applied TRIM(), PROPER(), and UPPER() to fix inconsistent text formatting.

Standardized location names and job titles.

Splitting and Merging Columns

Used Text to Columns to split full names and locations.

Combined relevant fields (e.g., Job Title + Level).

Data Type Conversion

Converted salary values from text to number.

Formatted date fields to consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Outlier Detection (Basic)

Applied conditional formatting to highlight extremely high or low salaries.

Used filters to review and validate outliers manually.

Data Validation

Created drop-downs and applied validation rules to fix inconsistent categories (e.g., Employment Type).

Using Formulas

IF(), LEN(), FIND(), TEXT(), SUBSTITUTE() for logic and transformations.

Documentation

Added a dedicated sheet explaining each step and rationale.
